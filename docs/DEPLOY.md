# Overview

Deploy usage guide and design decision.

## Multi-stage, multi-region deploy

By default, all functions are deploy to a stage (`dev`) and a region.  The
autogenerated resource group name will reflect this information.  The name 
follow the Microsoft recommended [naming convention](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/best-practices/naming-conventions#general).

### Using exitsing resource group

`sls deploy -s dev -r westus2 -g myResourceGroup`

- Use resource group `myResourceGroup`
- Create/Update app service plan, app service
- Zipdeploy code

### No resource group specified

`sls deploy -s dev -r westus2`

- Create if not exist resource group `<service>-dev-westus2-rg`
- Create/Update app service plan, app service
- Zipdeploy code

### Design decision on resource group support

#### Specifying resourceGroup in serverless.yml

- it is not clear if a resourceGroup has already been associated with a given stage and region.  

For example, we have the following default config

```yaml
provider:
  stage: dev
  region: westus
  resourceGroup: myResourceGroup
```

then user try to deploy
`sls deploy -s prod -r westus`

1. Do we use the environment variables / creds associated with `dev` or `prod`?
1. Someone new to the codecase see both the `serverless.yaml` and the command in a CD script, how can they tell which resourceGroup goes where.

#### Specifying resourceGroup in command line

`sls deploy -s prod -r westus -g prodResourceGroup`

1. With this format, it's more clear which stage+region combo is associated with a resourceGroup.  
1. User can still make mistake, however, and use the `wrong` resource group for a specific stage.

#### Don't support user defined resource group

1. always using the right resource group
1. restrictive for user who have already defined their resources
